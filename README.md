**Phew** is an open-source <a href="http://flif.info">FLIF</a> image viewer and QuickLook plugin for macOS.

The <strong><a href="http://flif.info">Free Lossless Image Format</a></strong> or <strong>FLIF</strong> is a novel lossless image format which outperforms PNG, lossless WebP, lossless BPG, lossless JPEG2000, and lossless JPEG XR in terms of compression ratio.

Phew can open and display FLIF images, and can export them as PNG, TIFF, BMP or raw pixel data. If the accompanying QuickLook Plug-In is installed, FLIF images show thumbnails and previews in the Finder and Spotlight just like regular images.

## Installation

* **[Download Phew 1.0](http://sveinbjorn.org/files/software/phew/Phew-1.0.zip)** (Intel 64-bit, macOS 10.10 or later, ~1.7 MB)
* [Sample FLIF images](sample-images/)

The Phew source code contains the <code>FLIFImage</code> class, which is an Objective-C wrapper to easily read images in the FLIF format via <code>libflif</code>. This class is available via <a href="https://cocoapods.org">CocoaPods</a>. See below for further info.

Phew is also available through [Homebrew Caskroom](https://caskroom.github.io

## FLIFImage Objective-C Class

<code>FLIFImage</code> is an Objective-C wrapper to easily read images in the FLIF format via <code>libflif</code>, the official FLIF reference decoder implementation. You can install via <a href="https://cocoapods.org">CocoaPods</a>. 

FLIFImage exposes the following class methods:

    + (BOOL)isFLIFImageAtPath:(NSString *)path;
    + (BOOL)isFLIFImageData:(NSData *)data;

    + (NSImage *)imageFromFileAtPath:(NSString *)path;
    + (CGImageRef)newCGImageFromFileAtPath:(NSString *)path;

    + (NSImage *)imageFromData:(NSData *)data;
    + (CGImageRef)newCGImageFromData:(NSData *)data;

Those calling <code>newCGImage*</code> methods are responsible for releasing the returned CGImageRef.
